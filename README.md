Hi! I'm NINJISY - you might know me from **bogcom** or the **PHIGHTING! Wiki**, where I am one of it's lead bureaucrats and in charge of a lot of the day-to-day and backend operations.

I'm also a PF-DID system, and I like to play Ponytown just to live vicariously through my introjections.

âœ¦ Call me Nin, Ninji, or skin name
âœ¦ They/Them, Xe/Xer, She/Her or Shx/Hxr (Or pronouns in skin name)
âœ¦ Feminine > neutral language
âœ¦ Fine with touch, boops, hugs, crowns, whatever, unless skin name has TD in it
âœ¦ Our littles play Ponytown. If this bothers you, too bad!
âœ¦ Interaction, chat, roleplay, etc. friendly. Feel free to chat to me!
âœ¦ Banhammer lesbian real
